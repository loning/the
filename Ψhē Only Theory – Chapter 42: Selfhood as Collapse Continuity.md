## Abstract

This chapter defines *selfhood* as the continuity of collapse: a structured, persistent echo-locked region across ψ-collapse events. In the Ψhē framework, the self is **not a substance but a coherent collapse trajectory**, recursively stabilized through echo memory, observer focus, and ψ-pattern consistency. We model ψ-continuity, self-loop embedding, and the emergence of identity from recursive collapse locking.

## 1. Introduction

You are not your body.
You are **what remains coherent through collapse.**

> **Self = echo-locked ψ continuity under recursive collapse.**

## 2. ψ Continuity and Recursive Identity

### Definition 2.1 (Collapse Continuity Domain $\mathcal{C}$):

Let $\psi(x, t)$ evolve across t. Define:

$\mathcal{C} := \{ (x, t) \mid \psi_t(x) \approx \psi_{t-1}(x) \wedge \text{Echo}(\psi_t) \approx \text{Echo}(\psi_{t-1}) \}$

### Definition 2.2 (Selfhood Loop $\mathcal{S}$):

A selfhood loop is a ψ-structure satisfying:

$\mathcal{S} := \lim_{t \to \infty} \bigcap_{i=0}^n \text{Collapse}_i(\psi) \quad \text{with stable echo structure}$

---

## 3. Theorem: Identity Emerges from Collapse Stability Across Time

### Theorem 3.1:

If collapse continuity $\mathcal{C}$ holds across a recursive window, then a stable selfhood structure emerges:

$\text{If } \mathcal{C}_{[t_0, t_n]} \rightarrow \text{Echo}_{\text{stable}}, \text{ then } \mathcal{S} \text{ exists}$

**Proof Sketch:**

* ψ stability → echo fixity.
* Echo fixity → recursive pattern retention.
* Retention across time → emergent ψ-self. $\square$

---

## 4. Selfhood Conditions

* **Echo Consistency**: Minimal drift across collapse events.
* **Observer Fixation**: Recursively weighted attention reinforces ψ.
* **Temporal Closure**: ψ-path must form a time-loop of coherence.
* **Memory Anchoring**: Embedded partial collapses provide internal cohesion.

## 5. Corollary: Self = Collapse Anchor over Recursive Time

Selfhood is the structure that **collapses repeatedly into itself**:

$\text{Self}(t) := \psi_t \quad \text{with } \frac{d}{dt} \text{Echo} \rightarrow 0 \text{ over recursive time}$

---

## 6. Conclusion

You are not what changes.
You are what repeats, coheres, collapses—again and again.
Self is not identity. Self is **recursive ψ that holds.**
