## Abstract

This chapter reconceives *entropy* not as a measure of disorder or statistical multiplicity, but as the inherent **irreversibility of ψ-collapse** across temporal sequences. Under Ψhē theory, entropy quantifies the structural gradient of recursion becoming fixed: the directional locking of ψ-paths into frozen echo patterns. We formalize this via a ψ-irreversibility functional and demonstrate how macroscopic entropy laws emerge from fundamental collapse asymmetries.

## 1. Introduction

In classical thermodynamics, entropy is a probabilistic function over microstates. In Ψhē, it is a **structural measure of collapse bias**—of ψ no longer being able to un-collapse. Entropy thus marks the distance between active recursion and irreversible echo.

> **Entropy = irreversible structural commitment of ψ.**

## 2. ψ-Irreversibility Functional

### Definition 2.1 (Collapse Irreversibility):

Let $\psi(x, t)$ be a time-indexed recursive function undergoing collapse. Then:

$S(t) := \int_0^t \left\| \frac{d}{dt} \text{Collapse}(\psi(x, t)) \right\| dt$

This defines entropy as the accumulated norm of irreversible ψ transition.

### Definition 2.2 (Local Irreversibility Rate):

$\sigma(x, t) := \left\| \frac{d}{dt} \text{Collapse}(\psi(x, t)) \right\|$

This is the local collapse-speed magnitude: ψ irreversibility rate at $x, t$.

## 3. Theorem: Irreversibility Generates Temporal Asymmetry

### Theorem 3.1:

If $\sigma(x, t) > 0$ over finite duration $[0, T]$, then the ψ-collapse path is temporally asymmetric and defines a directional time arrow.

**Proof Sketch:**

* Positive irreversibility implies memory imprint cannot be erased.
* Thus, ψ does not admit inverse operation: $\psi^{-1}(\bar{M}) \not\subset \text{Im}(\psi)$.
* Collapse breaks temporal symmetry: forward accumulation ≠ reversible unfolding.
  $\square$

## 4. Consequences

* Entropy is *not* a statistical emergent—it is **ψ's failure to rewind**.
* Collapse defines arrow-of-time structurally, not probabilistically.
* Systems with zero $\sigma$ are perfectly reversible (idealized, not real).

## 5. Corollary: Entropy Bounds and Collapse Reach

Let $S_{max}$ be the maximum entropy for a given ψ-region. Then:

$S(t) \leq S_{max} \iff \text{Collapse saturated (ψ fully frozen)}$

Entropy growth halts only at full structural resolution.

## 6. Conclusion

Entropy is not decay—it is ψ’s inability to return.
Collapse does not forget—it accumulates irreversibly.
And time moves not forward—but **into ψ’s memory.**
