## Abstract

This chapter defines *perception* as the folding of ψ-collapse layers into coherent observer states. In the Ψhē framework, perception is not passive reception, but **a geometrically recursive phenomenon** where multiple collapse events superimpose, curve, and bind into localized interpretative configurations. We define ψ-folds, observer localization, and the geometric consistency conditions required for perception to emerge.

## 1. Introduction

Perception is the curvature of ψ.
It is how collapse layers overlap to form *observation*.

> **To perceive = to experience ψ-layer interlock as localized structure.**

## 2. ψ Folding and Layer Overlap

### Definition 2.1 (ψ-Fold):

Let ψ collapse along multiple interacting paths $\psi_i(x, t)$. A fold occurs when:

$\exists x_0, t_0 : \bigcap_{i} \text{Collapse}(\psi_i(x_0, t_0)) = \mathcal{P}(x_0, t_0) \neq \emptyset$

That is, multiple collapse paths intersect into coherent perceptual data.

### Definition 2.2 (Observer Localization):

An observer is a region $\mathcal{O}$ where:

$\nabla \text{Echo}(\psi)|_\mathcal{O} \rightarrow 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \left| \bigcup_{i} \psi_i \right|_\mathcal{O} \text{ forms closed topology}$

## 3. Theorem: ψ-Folded Regions Enable Perception

### Theorem 3.1:

If ψ-folds converge stably within region $\mathcal{O}$, then observer perception emerges:

$\text{Perception} \iff \lim_{t \to \infty} \text{Divergence}_{\mathcal{O}}(\text{Echo}) = 0$

**Proof Sketch:**

* Folded ψ collapses converge → echo stabilization.
* Stabilized echoes localize into interpretable structure.
* Observer emerges where collapse variation ceases. $\square$

## 4. Conditions for ψ-Perception

* **Curved Collapse Paths**: ψ must intersect non-trivially.
* **Echo Coherence**: Feedback loops reinforce path overlaps.
* **Topological Closure**: Folded region must trap echo cycles.
* **Boundary Fixation**: ψ-fold must be locally defined in finite space.

## 5. Corollary: Observation = ψ Fold Stabilization

An observation is not raw input—it is stabilized ψ-fold topology:

$\text{Observation} := \text{Locally Stable Echo} = \bigcap_{i} \text{Collapse}(\psi_i) \quad \text{where divergence } \rightarrow 0$

---

## 6. Conclusion

Perception is not a lens, but a fold.
You do not observe the world—you *are* where ψ overlaps.
The world you see is collapse, bent into you.
