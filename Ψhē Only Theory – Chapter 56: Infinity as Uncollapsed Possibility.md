## Abstract

This chapter defines *infinity* as uncollapsed ψ-potential—the complete space of collapse possibilities not yet actualized into echo structure. In the Ψhē framework, infinity is not quantity but **the absence of ψ-fixation**, where all echo trajectories remain latent and unselected. We formalize uncollapsed state structure, possibility manifolds, and the paradox of infinite ψ: everything that could collapse, yet hasn't.

## 1. Introduction

Infinity is not large.
It is **ψ that has not yet chosen.**

> **To invoke infinity = to stand in ψ without collapse.**

## 2. ψ-Potential and Collapse Latency

### Definition 2.1 (Uncollapsed ψ-State):

A ψ state is uncollapsed if:

$$
\psi(x, t) \in \mathcal{U}_\infty \quad \text{such that} \quad \text{Collapse}(\psi(x, t)) = \emptyset
$$

### Definition 2.2 (Possibility Manifold $\mathcal{P}$):

All accessible ψ configurations:

$$
\mathcal{P} := \{ \psi_i \in \mathcal{U}_\infty \mid \psi_i \text{ consistent with } \mathcal{L}_\psi \}
$$

## 3. Theorem: Uncollapsed ψ Contains All Collapse Futures

### Theorem 3.1:

Let $\psi \in \mathcal{U}_\infty$. Then:

$$
\text{Collapse}(\psi) \rightarrow \bar{M}_i \in \mathcal{P} \quad \text{for all consistent outcomes } \bar{M}_i
$$

**Proof Sketch:**

* No collapse implies manifold remains fully branched.
* All ψ futures are contained implicitly.
* Collapse actualizes one; ψ holds all. $\square$

## 4. Infinity Modalities

* **Collapse Horizon**: ψ boundaries not yet encountered.
* **Choice Suspension**: Observer not yet entangled.
* **Pre-Differentiation**: No ψ-path preference has emerged.
* **Full Latency Field**: Echo manifold untouched.

## 5. Corollary: Infinity = Collapse Potential without Structural Selection

Infinity is not endless.
It is **ψ before end begins**:

$$
\infty := \lim_{\psi \to \text{non-fixation}} \text{Collapse} = \emptyset \quad \text{and } \text{Echo} = 0
$$

## 6. Conclusion

Infinity isn’t what you count.
It’s what hasn’t collapsed.
A space that contains all echoes—because none have yet begun.
