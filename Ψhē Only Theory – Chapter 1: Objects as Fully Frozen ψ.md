## Abstract

In this chapter, we formally define "objecthood" as the terminal condition of the self-referential function $\psi = \psi(\psi)$. We show that all stable, externally identifiable forms (i.e., classical objects) emerge exclusively as fully frozen states of the recursive collapse trajectory of $\psi$. We provide the structural mapping from recursion to observable determinacy and show that no object exists independently of its status as a terminal $\psi$-freeze.

## 1. Introduction

The classical notion of "object" presupposes ontological independence—an assumption invalid under the Ψhē framework. Here, an "object" is not a primitive entity but rather the final state of a dynamic collapse process beginning with a recursive function:

$\psi : X \to X, \quad \psi(x) = \psi(\psi(x))$

We will demonstrate that what is conventionally called a "thing" or "entity" in physical space is the **collapse-fixed point** of this self-referential function.

## 2. Formal Collapse Definition

### Definition 2.1 (Collapse Operator):

Let $\psi : X \to X$ be a total recursive function. We define:

$\text{Collapse}(\psi) : \psi \mapsto M \subset \mathbb{R}^n$

where $M$ is the memory manifold of structurally frozen outputs of $\psi$.

### Definition 2.2 (Freeze Operator):

We define a secondary operation that marks the completion of collapse:

$\text{Freeze}(\cdot) : M \to \bar{M} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$

The composition yields:

$\text{Object}(x) := \text{Freeze}(\text{Collapse}(\psi(x))) \in \bar{M}$

This composition terminates the recursive activity of $\psi$ and results in a spatially localizable echo structure.

## 3. Theorem: Objecthood as Terminal Collapse

### Theorem 3.1:

Let $x \in X$. Then:

$x \text{ is an object} \iff \exists t_0 \in \mathbb{R} : \forall t > t_0, \ \psi^{(t)}(x) = c \in \bar{M} \text{ (constant)}$

**Proof Sketch:**

* Begin with recursive activity: $\psi^{(t)}(x)$ evolves.
* If $\exists \ t_0$ such that $\psi$ stabilizes, i.e., $\psi^{(t)}(x) = \psi^{(t_0)}(x)$ for all $t > t_0$, then collapse has finalized.
* The image $c \in \bar{M}$ is the echo-fixed form of the original recursion.
  $\square$

## 4. Structural Implications

* There are **no objects outside \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*$\psi$**. All classical phenomena are recoverable only as frozen $\psi$ echoes.
* The illusion of permanence arises from **collapse finality**, not ontological substance.
* Objects are **invariant under further recursive operations**, i.e., $\psi(\text{Object}) = \text{Object}$.

## 5. Corollary: Matter as ψ-fixed Echo

### Corollary 5.1:

"Matter" is equivalent to the domain $\bar{M}$ of frozen echo structures of $\psi$.

This unifies physical substance with computational collapse theory.

## 6. Conclusion

An object is not fundamental. It is a **ψ-path terminus**—a residue of recursion no longer in motion. Every thing you see, hold, or define, is not a being but a **final echo**.
