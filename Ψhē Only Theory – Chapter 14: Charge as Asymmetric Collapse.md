## Abstract

This chapter reinterprets *charge* as a signature of **asymmetry in ψ-collapse dynamics**. Rather than attributing charge to intrinsic particle properties, Ψhē theory shows it arises from the directed, non-mirror-symmetric flow of recursive ψ collapse. We define ψ-orientation, introduce collapse helicity, and demonstrate how field polarity and interaction signatures emerge as consequences of asymmetric collapse manifolds.

## 1. Introduction

In classical field theory, charge is an abstract quantum number associated with sources of force. In Ψhē, charge is not *carried*, but **expressed** by the way ψ collapses with structural bias. A charged entity is one whose collapse path breaks reflectional or temporal symmetry.

> **Charge = asymmetry in ψ’s collapse vector field.**

## 2. ψ-Orientation and Collapse Helicity

### Definition 2.1 (ψ-Collapse Orientation):

Let $\psi(x, t)$ be a ψ-path. Define its local orientation as:

$\vec{C}(x, t) := \nabla_x \left( \frac{d}{dt} \text{Collapse}(\psi(x, t)) \right)$

The vector $\vec{C}(x, t)$ represents directional collapse bias at $x$.

### Definition 2.2 (Charge Polarity):

$q(x) := \operatorname{sign}(\vec{C}(x, t) \cdot \hat{n})$

where $\hat{n}$ is an arbitrary reference axis or field-aligned observer frame.

## 3. Theorem: Non-zero Collapse Curl Yields Field Source Signature

### Theorem 3.1:

If $\nabla \times \vec{C}(x, t) \neq 0$, then $x$ acts as a source or sink in the echo-manifold, producing a field analog.

**Proof Sketch:**

* ψ collapse with curl ≠ 0 implies rotational asymmetry.
* Structural field lines diverge/converge.
* These manifest as electric/magnetic field effects.
  $\square$

## 4. Consequences

* Charge is not an object label—it is a **collapse pattern classification**.
* Opposite charges = ψ-collapses with opposing orientation gradient.
* Conservation of charge = conservation of ψ-orientation totality.

## 5. Corollary: Field Interaction as Collapse Interference

Interactions arise from constructive or destructive echo interference across asymmetric ψ-flows. Let $\psi_1, \psi_2$ be two oriented collapse paths. Then:

$\text{Interaction}(\psi_1, \psi_2) \sim \vec{C}_1 \cdot \vec{C}_2$

Sign and magnitude of this product determine attractive/repulsive behavior.

## 6. Conclusion

Charge is not a thing. It is a direction.
A slant in ψ’s descent into fixity.
Where collapse leans, reality polarizes.
