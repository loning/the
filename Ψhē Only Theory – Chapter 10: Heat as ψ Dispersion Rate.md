## Abstract

This chapter redefines *heat* as the measurable dispersion rate of active ψ-collapse across a local manifold. In contrast to classical thermodynamics—which treats heat as transferred energy—Ψhē theory interprets it as the spatial-temporal gradient of unfrozen ψ-density undergoing collapse. We formalize the ψ-dispersion operator and show that thermal dynamics are emergent from collapse diffusion rates in the ψ-field.

## 1. Introduction

In classical physics, heat is a function of energy transfer and molecular motion. In Ψhē, heat is a **collapse phenomenon**: a measure of how rapidly ψ-structures propagate and stabilize their recursion across adjacent coordinates in $\bar{M}$.

Thus:

> **Heat = ψ-collapse per unit manifold area over time.**

## 2. Collapse Gradient and Dispersion Rate

### Definition 2.1 (ψ-Dispersion Field):

Let $\psi(x, t)$ be a time-evolving collapse path over spatial point $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Then define:

$H(x, t) := \left\| \nabla_x \left( \frac{d}{dt} \text{Collapse}(\psi(x, t)) \right) \right\|$

This represents the **instantaneous local heat** at point $x$ and time $t$.

### Definition 2.2 (Global Heat):

Over region $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, the integrated heat is:

$Q(t) = \int_\Omega H(x, t) \, dx$

## 3. Theorem: ψ Collapse Gradient Implies Thermal Flow

### Theorem 3.1:

If $H(x, t)$ is nonzero and smooth, then ψ collapse induces a continuous thermal field.

**Proof Sketch:**

* Collapse varies across $x$ ⇒ spatial dispersion exists.
* Temporal change induces ∇ψ propagation across manifold.
* Gradient implies flow: thus, ψ dynamics map to heat field.

## 4. Physical Interpretation

| Thermodynamic Quantity | ψ-Equivalent Collapse Expression                   |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Heat (local)           | $H(x, t) = \|\nabla_x (d/dt \, \text{Collapse})\|$ |
| Temperature            | Collapse flux per observer-aligned coordinate      |
| Conduction             | ψ propagation through overlapping collapse-paths   |

## 5. Corollary: Second Law as Collapse Rate Monotonicity

In isolated systems, collapse is strictly directional (non-reversible). Therefore:

$\frac{d}{dt} Q(t) \geq 0$

ψ-dispersion increases total echo density over time.

## 6. Conclusion

Heat is not energy. Heat is the shape of ψ in motion.
The world grows warm where ψ spreads and settles—
not because particles collide,
but because recursion finds its edge.
