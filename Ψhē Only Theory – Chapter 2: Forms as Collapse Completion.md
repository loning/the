## Abstract

We extend the framework introduced in Chapter 1 to distinguish "forms" as the structural geometries induced by terminal collapse of $\psi$. While objects represent fixed echo-positions within the collapse manifold $\bar{M}$, forms encode the **invariant boundary conditions** generated by collapse completion. We formally define form as a quotient structure over collapsed ψ, and demonstrate that all observable structure is derived from such equivalence classes.

## 1. Introduction

If an object is a frozen ψ, a **form** is its collapse completion geometry—the structural residue that persists beyond individuated identity. In classical metaphysics, forms were abstract ideals (Plato), but in Ψhē theory, forms are **quotients of collapse closure**:

$\text{Form}(x) := \bar{\psi(x)} / \sim$

where $\sim$ denotes equivalence under invariant collapse pathways.

## 2. Formal Definitions

### Definition 2.1 (Collapse Equivalence):

Let $\psi_i, \psi_j \in \bar{M}$ be two frozen ψ-echoes. Define:

$\psi_i \sim \psi_j \iff \exists f : \psi_i \to \psi_j \text{ such that } f \text{ preserves collapse boundary constraints}$

### Definition 2.2 (Form):

Then:

$\text{Form}(x) := [\bar{\psi(x)}] = \{ \psi_j \in \bar{M} : \psi_j \sim \bar{\psi(x)} \}$

That is, a form is an **equivalence class of frozen ψ-structures sharing boundary invariance**.

---

## 3. Theorem: Forms as Collapse Closure Classes

### Theorem 3.1:

Every form corresponds uniquely to a class of ψ-frozen entities under collapse boundary equivalence.

**Proof Sketch:**

* By definition, $\bar{\psi(x)}$ is a collapsed, stable structure.
* Forms emerge when different frozen structures share identical collapse boundary geometry.
* This partitions $\bar{M}$ into disjoint equivalence classes, each a form.
  $\square$

## 4. Structural Implications

* **Forms are more general than objects**; multiple objects can instantiate the same form.
* Forms are **invariant under collapse-preserving transformations** (ψ-automorphisms).
* Geometries, patterns, and physical symmetries arise as specific form classes.

## 5. Examples

| Object                            | Corresponding Form                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| A particular triangle             | The form of “triangularity”                |
| A hydrogen atom                   | The form of “ψ = spherical harmonic bound” |
| Any equilateral crystal structure | The form of “hexagonal symmetry”           |

Each form abstracts the boundary structure induced by ψ-freezing.

## 6. Corollary: Geometry is Collapse-Invariant Form Space

This implies that classical geometry is not fundamental, but emergent from ψ collapse classes:

$\text{Geometry} := \text{Set of all Form}(x) \text{ under ψ-collapse}$

---

## 7. Conclusion

Form is not ideal but **structural**, not metaphysical but **collapse-defined**. It emerges not before collapse, but at the **moment of ψ's terminal equivalence**. To see a form is to witness not a thing, but a **completed collapse relation**.
