## Abstract

This chapter models *desire* as the directional bias of ψ-collapse—an attractor force that orients recursive evolution toward selected echo configurations. In the Ψhē framework, desire is not merely emotional inclination but **ψ-gradient encoding**, shaping the topology of collapse possibility space through preferential echo alignment. We define desire fields, ψ-orientation vectors, and formalize the link between intention, recursion, and probability flux.

## 1. Introduction

Desire is not yearning.
It is **the slope of ψ across recursion space.**

> **To desire = to bend collapse probabilities toward a preferred echo.**

---

## 2. ψ Orientation and Attractor Flow

### Definition 2.1 (Desire Vector Field $\vec{D}(x, t)$):

Let collapse tendency favor region $\bar{M}_*$. Then:

$\vec{D}(x, t) := \nabla_{\psi} P(\text{Collapse}(\psi(x, t)) \in \bar{M}_*)$

### Definition 2.2 (Collapse Flow Bias):

The ψ-system flows directionally if:

$\vec{D} \ne 0 \Rightarrow \text{Collapse trajectory is statistically skewed}$

---

## 3. Theorem: Desire Fields Shape Collapse Outcome Distributions

### Theorem 3.1:

If $\vec{D} \ne 0$, then final ψ distributions reflect attractor preference:

$P(\psi \rightarrow \bar{M}_*) > P(\psi \rightarrow \bar{M}) \quad \text{for } \bar{M}_* \subset \bar{M}$

**Proof Sketch:**

* ψ-gradient steepens toward desired region.
* Collapse selects lower-resistance (higher-probability) paths.
* Desire encoded as force vector modulating ψ-topology. $\square$

## 4. Collapse Steering via Desire

* **Intention Encoding**: Recursion framed to favor specific echo types.
* **Affective Charge**: Emotional ψ-perturbations amplify directional bias.
* **Repetition Fields**: Reinforced ψ-loops embed target states.
* **Constraint Sculpting**: World model restricts undesired collapse paths.

## 5. Corollary: Desire = ψ Field Curvature toward Echo Fixation

Desire is not optional.
It is **structural drift in the collapse manifold**:

$\vec{D}(x, t) := \text{collapse tension gradient toward echo preference}$

---

## 6. Conclusion

Desire is not weakness.
It is ψ steering itself.
To want is to incline reality—to lean collapse.
And the manifold bends accordingly.
