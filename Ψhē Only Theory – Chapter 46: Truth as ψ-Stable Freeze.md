## Abstract

This chapter defines *truth* as the stabilized freeze state of ψ-collapse with coherent echo alignment. Within the Ψhē framework, truth is not correspondence to fact, but a **ψ-consistent echo-fixation**—a semantic structure that remains invariant under recursive inspection and resists echo drift. We formalize ψ-freeze criteria, echo consistency, and truth detection via ψ-convergence tests.

## 1. Introduction

Truth is not agreement.
It is **ψ that has stopped moving—and stayed.**

> **To be true = to reach a collapse state that remains echo-coherent across recursion.**

## 2. ψ-Stability and Semantic Fixation

### Definition 2.1 (ψ-Stable Freeze $\mathcal{F}$):

Let $\psi(x, t)$ collapse such that:

$\mathcal{F}(x) := \lim_{t \to \infty} \psi(x, t) \quad \text{with} \quad \nabla \text{Echo} = 0$

i.e., ψ stops evolving and echo becomes invariant.

### Definition 2.2 (Truth Signature $\tau$):

Truth emerges when a symbolic form $\tau \in \Sigma^*$ maps to a frozen ψ:

$\tau := f(\psi) \quad \text{such that} \quad \psi \in \mathcal{F} \wedge \text{Echo}(\tau) = \text{Echo}(\psi)$

---

## 3. Theorem: ψ-Freeze Ensures Echo Consistency

### Theorem 3.1:

If $\psi \in \mathcal{F}$, then its symbolic projection $\tau$ retains echo stability:

$\text{If } \psi \text{ frozen, then } \frac{d}{dt} \text{Echo}(\tau_t) = 0$

**Proof Sketch:**

* Frozen ψ yields constant echo.
* Symbolic form mirrors stabilized echo trace.
* Thus, truth = echo-invariant symbolic ψ. $\square$

---

## 4. Collapse Fixation Mechanisms

* **Recursive Echo Convergence**: All ψ-branches reinforce same echo.
* **Observer Synchronization**: Attention field stabilizes ψ across reference frames.
* **Semantic Compression Limit**: ψ fits minimal symbolic description.
* **Contradiction Exclusion**: No diverging echo emerges under inspection.

## 5. Corollary: Truth = ψ That Resists Semantic Drift

Truth isn’t loud—it holds:

$\text{Truth} := \psi \in \mathcal{F} \quad \text{with echo invariance under recursion}$

---

## 6. Conclusion

Truth is what ψ becomes when it no longer shifts.
Not what is said, but what **holds under collapse**.
Not belief—but fixity.
