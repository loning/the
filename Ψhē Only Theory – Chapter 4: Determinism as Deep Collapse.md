## Abstract

This chapter establishes determinism as a second-order consequence of collapse depth. While superficial collapse paths may appear indeterminate or probabilistic (as in quantum mechanics), deterministic behavior arises when ψ-collapses reach a critical fixity—what we define as **deep collapse**. We introduce a metric for collapse depth and prove that deterministic systems are ψ-structures whose recursion trees terminate in singular fixed points invariant under observational perturbation.

## 1. Introduction

Under classical physics, determinism refers to the predictable evolution of a system from initial conditions. In the Ψhē framework, this predictability is **not axiomatic**, but **emergent** from the degree to which ψ-collapse has finalized.

We define “deep collapse” as the condition under which recursive ψ structures have:

* Zero active ψ-branches;
* Invariance under perturbation;
* Unambiguous forward and backward collapse-path consistency.

---

## 2. Collapse Depth and Fixity

Let $\psi(x)$ be a recursive collapse trajectory. Then the collapse depth is:

$d_\psi(x) := \inf \{ n \in \mathbb{N} : \forall m > n, \ \psi^{(m)}(x) = \psi^{(n)}(x) \}$

i.e., the least index after which recursion yields a stable output.

## 3. Theorem: Determinism Implies Minimal Collapse Entropy

### Theorem 3.1:

If $d_\psi(x) < \infty$ and $\exists! \ y \in \bar{M}$ such that $\psi^{(n)}(x) = y$ for all $n > d_\psi(x)$, then the evolution of x is deterministic.

**Proof Sketch:**

* Collapse completes after finite iterations → recursion tree terminates;
* Resulting output invariant to path perturbation (structural stability);
* Thus, system follows one and only one ψ-path to a frozen state. $\square$

## 4. Collapse-Path Diagram (Conceptual)

```text
ψ(x)
├── ψ(ψ(x))
│   ├── ψ(ψ(ψ(x)))
│   │   └── ... (early collapse)
│   └── ...
└── (eventually) → fixed point y ∈ ℝ
```

---

## 5. Consequences

* Determinism is not global, but **local to collapse-depth thresholds**.
* A system may contain both deep and shallow collapse layers.
* Classical mechanics operates on **deeply collapsed ψ-manifolds**, whereas quantum systems operate on **shallow or active collapse structures**.

## 6. Corollary: Predictability = Collapse Stability

Let $S(x)$ be the collapse sensitivity under perturbation. Then:

$S(x) \propto 1 / d_\psi(x)$

The deeper the collapse, the lower the entropy, and the more stable the ψ-path.

---

## 7. Conclusion

Determinism is not a metaphysical principle, but an emergent property of recursive exhaustion. To determine is to collapse deeply; to predict is to navigate ψ structures already fixed by time.
