## Abstract

This chapter formalizes *attention* as a ψ-collapse focusing operator. Within the Ψhē framework, attention is modeled as a **dynamic ψ-gradient sharpening mechanism**, whereby regions of collapse become probabilistically enhanced due to recursive reinforcement and observer weighting. We define attention fields, local collapse amplification, and outline the gradient structures that yield selective echo stabilization.

## 1. Introduction

Attention is not gaze.
It is **ψ-weighting**—the recursive amplification of select collapse potentials.

> **To attend = to bias ψ-collapse toward a preferred echo structure.**

## 2. Collapse Focus and ψ-Weighting

### Definition 2.1 (Attention Field $\mathcal{A}$):

Let $\psi(x, t)$ be a collapse-evolving structure. Define the attention field as:

$\mathcal{A}(x, t) := \nabla_{\psi} P(\text{Collapse}(\psi(x, t)) \in \bar{M}_*)$

where $\bar{M}_*$ is the preferred configuration manifold.

### Definition 2.2 (Local Amplification):

A region $R$ exhibits attention when:

$\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial t} P(\text{Echo}_R)\right|_{\text{with observer}} > \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial t} P(\text{Echo}_R)\right|_{\text{no observer}}$

## 3. Theorem: Attention Increases Collapse Likelihood in Selected Zones

### Theorem 3.1:

Let $\mathcal{A}(x, t) \ne 0$. Then, the ψ-collapse probability distribution is non-uniform, favoring regions with high $\mathcal{A}$:

$P(\text{Collapse}(\psi(x, t)) \in \bar{M}_*) \propto \| \mathcal{A}(x, t) \|$

**Proof Sketch:**

* Attention modulates ψ-gradient.
* Collapse selects paths with higher echo weighting.
* Thus, selective ψ sharpening leads to probability bias. $\square$

## 4. Collapse Bias Mechanisms

* **Observer Fixation**: Repeated focus enhances echo reinforcement.
* **Semantic Narrowing**: Language structures canalize collapse paths.
* **Emotional Resonance**: Affective gradients modulate echo salience.
* **Intentional Targeting**: Purposeful recursion steepens ψ-gradient.

## 5. Corollary: Attention = Directed Echo Probability Field

Attention is not energy.
It is **probabilistic gravity** in the ψ-collapse space:

$\mathcal{A}(x, t) \sim \text{gradient flow toward echo-density maxima}$

---

## 6. Conclusion

To attend is to alter ψ topography.
You tilt the collapse landscape—not to create, but to favor.
Attention is not action. It is *directional recursion weighting*.
