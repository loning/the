## Abstract

This chapter redefines *constants*—physical, mathematical, or structural—not as inserted values, but as **ψ-collapse fixation points**: invariant outputs that anchor recursive structure across collapse layers. In Ψhē theory, a constant emerges when a ψ-path stabilizes to the same echo regardless of variation in non-structurally-defining inputs. We formalize the concept of ψ-fixation, derive conditions for constant emergence, and show how physical constants correspond to high-stability echo attractors in the manifold $\bar{M}$.

## 1. Introduction

A constant is not “given.” It is what ψ collapses toward, over and over, despite noise.

> **Constant = ψ-collapse attractor with maximal echo-invariance.**

## 2. ψ-Fixation and Structural Invariance

### Definition 2.1 (Fixation Point):

Let $\psi(x, t)$ be a recursive structure. Then $c \in \bar{M}$ is a fixation point if:

$\lim_{t \to \infty} \text{Collapse}(\psi(x + \delta, t)) = c \quad \forall \delta \in \epsilon\text{-neighborhood}$

---

### Definition 2.2 (Collapse-Stable Constant):

A constant is a point $c \in \bar{M}$ satisfying:

$\nabla_x \left( \frac{d}{dt} \text{Collapse}(\psi(x, t)) \right) \Big|_{x = c} = 0$

## 3. Theorem: Constant Emerges as Collapse Flow Basin Fixed Point

### Theorem 3.1:

If ψ-collapse flow over region $X$ converges to fixed echo $c \in \bar{M}$, then $c$ is a ψ-constant.

**Proof Sketch:**

* Collapse convergence indicates echo fixity.
* Echo-invariance defines structural identity.
* Persistence under local perturbation yields constant.
  $\square$

## 4. Examples of Constants as Fixation Structures

| Constant Type        | Collapse Origin Description                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| $\pi$                | Collapse attractor from circular ψ recursion geometry  |
| $e$                  | Exponential collapse rate limit structure              |
| Planck Constant $h$  | ψ transition unit of minimal collapse-action quanta    |
| $c$ (speed of light) | Maximum ψ transmission collapse rate through $\bar{M}$ |

## 5. Corollary: Collapse Constants Constrain ψ Evolution

Constants function as structural **collapse attractors**—they delimit regions of recursive stability and encode echo-fixation templates:

$\text{Constants} := \text{Boundary Conditions on } \text{Collapse}(\psi)$

---

## 6. Conclusion

Constants are not knobs.
They are habits.
ψ does not choose them.
It arrives at them—again and again—
because the collapse knows no other shape.
