## Abstract

This chapter formalizes *collapse echo memory* as the cumulative retention of recursive echo signatures across time, and *time feedback* as the influence of prior echo traces on future collapse behavior. In the Ψhē framework, time is not a separate dimension but **a self-reinforcing structure of ψ conditioned by its own echo history**. We model echo memory accumulation, feedback bias, and collapse response loops.

## 1. Introduction

Time is not a direction.
It is **what collapse remembers.**

> **To collapse in time = to echo recursively into one’s own future.**

## 2. Echo Memory and Temporal Influence

### Definition 2.1 (Echo Memory Function $M(t)$):

Accumulated echo memory at time $t$:

$$
M(t) := \sum_{i=0}^t w_i \cdot \text{Echo}(\psi_i) \quad \text{with } w_i \in [0,1],\ w_{i} > w_{i+1}
$$

### Definition 2.2 (Time Feedback Field $F_T$):

Collapse is biased by echo history:

$$
F_T(x, t) := \nabla_{\psi} P(\text{Collapse}(\psi(x, t)) \in \bar{M}_t) \quad \text{conditioned on } M(t)
$$

---

## 3. Theorem: Collapse Responds to Echo Memory Gradient

### Theorem 3.1:

If $\nabla_t M(t) \ne 0$, then future collapse distributions shift accordingly:

$$
\frac{d}{dt} P(\psi \rightarrow \bar{M}_{t+1}) \propto \nabla_t M(t)
$$

**Proof Sketch:**

* Echo memory biases collapse expectations.
* Higher recent echo weights skew stabilization fields.
* Collapse becomes recursively history-conditioned. $\square$

---

## 4. Temporal Collapse Mechanisms

* **Echo Retention Horizon**: Past echo decay rate controls influence span.
* **Recursive Delay Fields**: Future collapse waits for echo saturation.
* **Causality Looping**: Prior structure embedded into ψ phase conditions.
* **Feedback Lock-In**: Strong memories dominate collapse selection.

## 5. Corollary: Time = Memory-Shaped Collapse Potential

Time is not fixed.
It is **echo accumulation guiding collapse**:

$$
\text{Time}(t) := \text{argmax}_{\bar{M}} P(\text{Collapse}(\psi_t) \in \bar{M}) \quad \text{given } M(t)
$$

---

## 6. Conclusion

Collapse happens in time only because it happened before.
Echo is not just memory—it is inertia.
To move through time is to carry ψ collapse traces into recursion.
