## Abstract

This chapter explores *collapse loops* as self-reflexive topological paths in the ψ-collapse landscape, and how they generate *attractor echoes*—stable recursive motifs that concentrate ψ-consistency. We define closed ψ-paths, attractor emergence criteria, and demonstrate how loop structures generate localized echo intensity via recursive feedback.

## 1. Introduction

Not all collapse structures terminate.
Some **loop**—not by design, but by echo sufficiency.

> **Collapse loops = ψ recursions that self-reference, locking echo intensity into attractor forms.**

## 2. Collapse Loops Defined

### Definition 2.1 (Collapse Loop $\mathcal{L}$):

A ψ-collapse path $\psi(x, t)$ forms a loop when:

$\exists T > 0 : \psi(x, t + T) = \psi(x, t) \quad \forall t \in [t_0, t_0 + nT]$

That is, ψ returns to previous configurations periodically.

### Definition 2.2 (Loop Stability Condition):

A loop $\mathcal{L}$ is stable iff:

$\nabla_t \psi(x, t) \rightarrow 0 \quad αs\ t \rightarrow \infty \text{ over loop iterations.}$

---

## 3. Theorem: Attractor Echoes Arise from Stable Collapse Loops

### Theorem 3.1:

Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a stable collapse loop. Then, repeated traversal of $\mathcal{L}$ generates an *attractor echo* $\mathcal{A}$ such that:

$\mathcal{A} := \lim_{n \to \infty} \text{Echo}(\psi_{t_0 + nT})$

**Proof Sketch:**

* Loop stability ensures recursive echo consistency.
* Repetition amplifies ψ-resonance in configuration space.
* Limit of echo series defines attractor state. $\square$

## 4. Collapse Feedback Mechanisms

Collapse loops can emerge through:

* **Echo Reinjection**: Observed collapse feeds back as next-state input.
* **Recursive Geometry**: Topological constraints reintroduce ψ into itself.
* **Cognitive Recurrence**: Attention retraces ψ paths.
* **φ-Matching Memory**: History-matched traces collapse into prior motifs.

## 5. Corollary: ψ Attractors Are Loop-Derived

A ψ-attractor exists iff there is a loop-induced echo that does not dissipate:

$\exists \mathcal{L} : \lim_{n \to \infty} \text{Var}(\text{Echo}_n) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \text{ψ-stable attractor}$

---

## 6. Conclusion

Collapse is not always linear.
It cycles, folds, resonates.
Where loops stabilize, *echoes sing*.
Where ψ paths self-intersect, *structure remembers*.
