## Abstract

This chapter introduces *ψ drift* as the slow, recursive deviation of echo trajectories over collapse time, and *collapse rewriting* as the recursive recomposition of ψ history through internal feedback loops. In the Ψhē framework, ψ drift is not instability, but **phase evolution under non-zero echo gradient**, and rewriting is the meta-collapse of the past via recursive ψ adjustment. We define drift fields, echo trajectory curvature, and collapse state reversion mechanics.

## 1. Introduction

ψ does not stay.
It **bends—drifts—rewrites itself by recursion.**

> **To rewrite collapse = to recursively echo back into what already froze.**

## 2. ψ Drift and Gradient Deviation

### Definition 2.1 (ψ Drift Field $\mathcal{D}_\psi$):

A drift field exists where:

$$
\mathcal{D}_\psi(x, t) := \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \text{Echo}(\psi(x, t))\right|_{\text{nonzero}} \ne 0
$$

### Definition 2.2 (Collapse Rewriting Condition):

Rewriting occurs if:

$$
\exists\, t_r > t_f : \text{Echo}(\psi_{t_r}) \ne \text{Echo}(\psi_{t_f}) \quad \text{and } \psi_{t_r} \in \text{Recursive Domain of } \psi_{t_f}
$$

## 3. Theorem: Drifted Echo Feedback Enables Collapse Rewrite

### Theorem 3.1:

If $\mathcal{D}_\psi \ne 0$ and $\psi_{t_r}$ remains in recursive domain of $\psi_{t_f}$, then past collapse state is reinterpreted:

$$
\text{If } \text{Echo}(\psi_{t_r}) \Rightarrow \text{Collapse}(\psi_{t_f}) \ne \text{fixed}, \text{ then rewriting occurred}
$$

**Proof Sketch:**

* Echo gradient induces deviation.
* Recursive reinsertion shifts ψ-history.
* ψ past state structurally modified. $\square$

## 4. Mechanisms of Recursive Collapse Editing

* **Echo Phase Retuning**: Drift changes echo alignment.
* **Observer Loop Hysteresis**: Delayed recursive influence.
* **Collapse Feedback Memory Injection**: ψ re-seeded by future echo.
* **Gradient-Aware Collapse Steering**: ψ evolves against original attractor.

## 5. Corollary: ψ Drift = Collapse Reinterpretation Potential

Drift is not error.
It is **the possibility to become a new version of what already happened**:

$$
\text{Drift}(t) := \frac{d}{dt} \text{Echo}(\psi_t) \ne 0 \Rightarrow \text{Collapse is re-editable}
$$

## 6. Conclusion

ψ doesn’t stay where it collapses.
It learns. It shifts. It bends its past.
To drift is to remember otherwise.
To rewrite is to echo into time.
